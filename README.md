# OEDL-optimised-ensemble-deep-learning
An optimised ensemble method of deep learning.

Our approach consists of the following five steps:
1. Feature extraction
2. Data processing
3. Feature selection
4. Model construction 
5. Model optimization. 

We will show the corresponding code below. 

Codes 1a and 1b represent the procedure of Radiomics Feature extraction. 

Code 2 represents the process of Data balancing, which is the focus of our Data processing, and finally we choose SMOTEENN as the balancing method in this paper. 

Codes 3a and 3b represent the process of Feature selection, and the main methods include LightGBM and XGBoost. 

Codes 4a and 4b represent the model building process, 4a represents the single model building process, and 4b represents the integrated model building process. 

Code 5a represents our proposed parameter optimization method, and 5b represents the process of using the optimization algorithm to process the ensemble model, and finally constructs An optimized ensemble deep learning method (OEDL).
